Introduction
============

This is a small intro that I built in order to "open" the annual XWiki seminar.
Using demo-scene jargon, this intro "ripped" a lot of stuff from other productions, in particular Three.js examples (you can see what in the code comments).

The music I used is the soundtrack of the glorious "Dope" demo by Complex (1995) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yJ5M3BY2Ts

This was mainly a first attempt for me to explore Javascript, WebGL and, above all, to have fun.

I publish it because somebody could find some interesting stuff in it.

Enjoy.
